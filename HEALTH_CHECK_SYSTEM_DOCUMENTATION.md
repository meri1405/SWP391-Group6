## Logic Flow

### 1. Campaign Creation and Approval
```
Nurse creates campaign → PENDING status → Manager notification
                     ↓
Manager approves/rejects → Nurse notification → Campaign status update
```

### 2. Student Notification and Form Generation
```
Approved campaign → Nurse sends notifications → Forms generated for eligible students
                                             ↓
Parents receive in-app notifications → Parents confirm/decline → Nurse receives confirmation notifications
```

### 3. Health Check Execution
```
Nurse records results → Health profile sync → Parent notification of results
                     ↓
If abnormal results → Additional notifications to parent and manager
```

### 4. Automated Scheduling
```
Daily checks for:
- Campaign deadlines (7, 3, 1 days remaining)
- Pending form reminders (3+ days old)
- Auto-completion of expired campaigns

Weekly:
- Campaign progress reports to managers
```

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Reporting
```java
// Add campaign analytics endpoint
@GetMapping("/campaigns/{id}/analytics")
public ResponseEntity<?> getCampaignAnalytics(@PathVariable Long id) {
    // Return participation rates, completion status, abnormal result counts
}
```

### 2. Parent Communication
```java
// Add parent message thread for health check discussions
@PostMapping("/forms/{formId}/messages")
public ResponseEntity<?> sendMessageToParent(@PathVariable Long formId, @RequestBody String message) {
    // Enable back-and-forth communication between nurse and parent
}
```

### 3. Integration with School Calendar
```java
// Sync health check campaigns with school events
@PostMapping("/campaigns/{id}/sync-calendar")
public ResponseEntity<?> syncWithSchoolCalendar(@PathVariable Long id) {
    // Avoid conflicts with school events
}
```

### 4. Mobile App Push Notifications
```java
// Add mobile push notification service
@Service
public class PushNotificationService {
    public void sendPushNotification(User user, String title, String message) {
        // Send push notifications to mobile app
    }
}
```
